I have relocated and am now practicing in Richmond Hill, ON, as of April 15, 2024. I am no longer practising at Eyes On Sheppard in North York, or Eyes On Weston in Vaughan.

Although I have provided care for some of you for years, your records, including clinical and contact information, belong to Eyes on Sheppard and Eyes On Weston. Any patient information may only be released with your consent. For this reason, I was unfortunately not able to give any of you prior notice of my relocation.

As a patient, it is important you know the options available to you to receive ongoing optometric care.

These options are:

* Remain at Eyes On Sheppard or Eyes On Weston and transfer care to the current optometrists-on-staff at these clinics. 

* Transfer to another practice in the area. Please visit the College of Optometrists of Ontario (https://www.collegeoptom.on.ca/) and click on the tab “Find An Optometrist” for a list of current practising optometrists.

* Continue your optometric care with Dr. Kristin Lao in Richmond Hill (Yonge / Major Mackenzie) and have your file transferred

Dr. Kristin Lao’s new practice address is  
**Richmond Hill Eye Associates (Yonge / Major Mackenzie)  
104 – 10350 Yonge St, Richmond Hill, ON L4C 5K9  
T: (905) 884-0061**

I am accepting appointment bookings for eye exams at Richmond Hill Eye Associates. While I do still practice at Bochner Eye Institute, I only provide post-operative care to surgical patients of Bochner Eye Institute.

**A personal note from Dr. Kristin Lao...**  
It has been such a great pleasure and honour to have provided eye care to you and your families over the years. It was not an easy decision for me to make, to relocate, as I have formed wonderful professional relationships with all of you. I hope that our paths will cross again in the future in some capacity. Best wishes to you and your families and for a healthy future!
